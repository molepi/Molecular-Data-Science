There are many good online resources for start learning R: 

1. For example at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
2. Or at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/#R)
3. Or focussed on Bioinformatic analysis at [bioc](http://master.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/)

In this introduction to R you should run a few examples/exercises from
the following Bioconductor courses:

1. [Intro to R](http://master.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/Moffitt/A1_Using_R.html)
2. [Data Input and Manipulation](https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/Moffitt/A2_IO.html)
3. [Statistical Analysis](https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/Moffitt/A3_Statistics.html)

In a few examples/exercises a datasets is required. These can be
downloaded from
[datasets](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocIntro/tree/Moffitt-2017/inst/extdata).
