These introductory practicals are designed to teach you the basics of R. At the end, we expect you to be able to follow along with the other practicals of this course. Please make sure that you turn your answers in to the blackboard at the end.  

***

## Part 1: RStudio and R Markdown

Open RStudio  

After opening a new R-script with `ctrl + shift + N`, you should have a layout similar to the image below.  

![Figure 1](https://github.com/molepi/Molecular-Data-Science/blob/master/RIntro_practical/figure.png?raw=true)  

You can type equations in the *Console* (see Figure) and R will calculate the result. Try this by typing the following equation in the Console:  

```{r}
1 + 1     
```

Using the `up arrow` and `down arrow` in the console, you can scroll through historical commands. These can also be viewed in the **History** tab of the *Environment* section (see Figure).

***

You can also type your code in the *R-script* (see Figure) and run a line or a selection using `ctrl + enter`. This is preferable to typing in the *Console* directly, since you can save the scripts for later use or share them with collaborators.

When installing packages for this FOS course, we created a new library for R. 

Set your library path to this destination by typing the following code and running it, and check that it worked. You will need to do this at the start of all FOS practicals in R.

```{r eval=FALSE}
.libPaths("C:/fos_2019/library")
.libPaths()
```

***

We advise you to use `R Markdown` documents during this course. These will not only let you save your script for later use, but also easily `knit` the results to a HTML and share those.

Open an `R Markdown` document by clicking the new document icon in the top left, and selecting *R Markdown...* from the drop-down menu. Give your document a name and keep HTML as the default output.

***

You will now see several different chunks, similar to this:

![Figure 1](https://github.com/molepi/Molecular-Data-Science/blob/master/RIntro_practical/markdown.PNG)  

***

Save your `R Markdown` document to a directory that you would like to work in, using the **Save** button (red). 

The **Knit** button (blue) at the top can be used to render a HTML document of your work. Try it now.

At the top of your document, between the `---` markers (yellow) is some information about your document. This includes the title you chose and the output type. 

Any plain text (orange) you write here can be used to describe or comment your code. You can specify different levels of header using `#`, bold with `**`, and italic with `*`. 

**Code chunks** (green) are initialized using the Insert drop down menu (top right) and selecting R.

If you want to run a single code chunk, you can do this using the **Run Current Chunk** button (pink).

***

Delete all the chunks **with the exception of the header** (yellow).

Write a brief description of what this document will contain along with a title. If you want to check how it will look, you can `Knit` your document at any time.

`R Markdown` is a great way to ensure reproducibility in research, and using it is a good habit to pick up early.

Copy the following equations in your `R Markdown` document in a code chunk, place your cursor on the first line, and run the equations line-by-line using ` ctrl + enter`. You can also select multiple lines and run them together, or run the entire chunk.

```
5 - 2         # subtraction
2 * 2         # multiplication
6 / 2         # division
3 ^ 2         # exponentiation
sqrt(9)       # square root
abs(-5)       # absolute value
```

***

In the **Environment** tab of the *Environment* section, you can view any stored variables available for use.  

You can store values in variables using the assignment operator, `<-`. Note that variable names in R are case-sensitive.

```{r}
x <- 1 + 1
x
```

You can list all currently saved variables, or remove them from memory. Remember, `rm()` is irreversible. If you want to use the variable again, you will need to redefine it.    

```{r}
ls()        # list all stored variables
rm(x)       # removing x
ls()

x <- 1 + 1  # redefining x
```

***

In the *bottom right* section of RStudio, are some very useful tabs. **Files** will display the content of the current working directory. You can set this using `setwd()` and view the path using `getwd()`.

Any **Plots** that you create can also be viewed here, and you can browse through your plot history with the `Forward` and `Back` buttons. 

The `tidyverse` package is a collection of popular R packages that can be installed together. It contains packages like `ggplot2`, mentioned in the lecture, for creating graphics, and `dplyr`, which we will use today for data manipulation.

A list of currently installed packages is shown in the **Packages** tab. The functions contained within these can be loaded into R with the `library()` function.

***

Now, let's load `tidyverse`:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We will use this package later in the practical. After loading a package into R, the functions inside become available for use.

Lastly, the **Help** tab can be used to view documentation on any loaded function. `Tab` can be used as autocomplete in R, but can also be used to browse options for completion. Find help on the function, `mean`.

```
?mean
```

***

#### Question 1:

* What does the `na.rm` option of the `mean` function do?
* What classes of input are accepted by the `sqrt` function?

*** 

## Part 2: Vectors

You can store multiple values in a vector using the concatenate function, `c()`.

```{r}
y <- c(5, 6, 7)
y
```

You can perform calculations on elements of a vector, using the same operators and functions you saw above. 

```{r}
x + y
y * 3
y ^ 2
```

***

You can also sum the elements of a vector using `sum()`, view the maximum value using `max()`, or return the number of elements using `length()`. Additionally, vectors can be reversed using `rev()`.   

```{r}
sum(y)
max(y)
length(y)
rev(y)
```

***

You can select specific values from a vector using square brackets. A sequence of values can be defined with `:`. Values can also be added to currently defined vectors using `c()`.  

```{r}
y[1]        # Return the first value of y
y[2:3]      # Return the second and third value of y
c(y, 8)     # Add an 8 as the last element of y
y[-3]       # Return all except the third value of y
```

***

Some functions can help you explore the nature of stored variables.   

```{r}
str(y)
class(y)
```

***

In this case, `y` is a numeric class object. A vector can also contain character data, defined using quotation marks.

```{r}
z <- c("a", "b", "c")
z
c(z, "d")
class(z)
```

For character class objects, `nchar()` can be used to count the number of letters.

```{r}
nchar("apple")
```


***

Another class of data in R is the logical class, where `T` represents TRUE and `F` represents FALSE. 

```{r}
w <- c(T,T,F)
w
class(w)
```

***

In addition to the above methods, there are other ways to subset vectors in R. These can either use numerical or logical vectors defined by `c()` or logical operators, such as `>`, `<=`, or `!=`.  

```{r}
y[c(1, 3)]    # Return the first and third value of y
z[w]          # Uses a logical vector to subset z
y[y == 6]     # Return all values of y equal to 6
z[z != "a"]   # Return all values of z not equal to "a"
y[y > 5]      # Return all values of y greater than 5
```

***

#### Question 2: Obtain the following vectors using the variables you have created. There are multiple ways to do this, but you only need to give one of them in your answers.

* `7`
* `"a", "c"`
* `5, 7, 9`
* `"c", "b", "a"`

***

## Part 3: Data Frames

R also has a data frame class which is comparable to a spreadsheet.  

You can click on a data frame in the **Environment** to view it. However, when the data frame is large it is better to use functions such as `str`, `summary`, `head` and `dim`.

Create a data frame, using the `data.frame()` function.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(y, z)  
df
class(df)
str(df)
summary(df)
```

***

You can view the dimensions of a data frame.

```{r}
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
dim(df)
```

***

You can add row names and column names to a data frame using `rownames()` and `colnames()`.  

```{r}
rownames(df) <- c("row1", "row2", "row3")
colnames(df) <- c("col1", "col2")
df
```

***

You can subset data frames in a similar manner to vectors, or using the `$` operator.  

```{r}
df[1, ]           # Return the first row
df[, 1]           # Return the first column
df[1, 1]          # Return the first value in the first column
df$col1           # Return column 'col1'
df[df$col1 > 5, ] # Return rows where column 'col1' is greater than 5
```

***

Extra columns can be added to a data frame using the `$` operator.   

```{r}
df$col3 <- w
df
```

Adding extra rows requires the `rbind()` function, and for values of the new row to be of the correct class.

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(col1 = 8, col2 = "d", col3 = F, row.names="row4") 
df3 <- rbind(df, df2) 
df3
```

***

#### Question 3:

* Add a column with the name `col4` to data frame `df` with the values `1, 1, 1`.
* Make a new data frame `df4`, which is a subset of data frame `df` but only contains columns `col1` and `col2`, and rows `row2` and `row3`.
* Calculate the sum of `col1` of data frame `df3`.
* Change the row names of data frame `df4` to `rowX` and `rowY`.

***

## Part 4: Real Data

We are now going to load a data set from the Framingham heart study [BioLINCC](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/). This data is stored as a .csv file, so we read it into R using `read.csv()`.

```{r}
fhs <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molepi/Molecular-Data-Science/master/RIntro_practical/data.csv"))
```

First, we want to explore the data.

```{r}
summary(fhs)
head(fhs)
str(fhs)
```

From looking at the above, we can see that this data frame contains 4434 observations of 12 variables. The first 11 variables represent values measured at baseline (e.g. sex, age), and the last variable, MI, represents whether of not the individual had suffered a myocardial infarction at 24 years after baseline. 

***

There are 642 missing values in the data. While there are various methods to handle these, we will look only at complete cases in this instance by removing observations with missing values.

```{r}
sum(is.na(fhs))
fhs <- fhs[complete.cases(fhs), ]
sum(is.na(fhs))
```

***

A very useful concept in R is the `formula`. This is specified as `lhs ~ rhs`, where the left-hand side is typically a dependent variable, and the right-hand side represents the independent variables, combined using `+`.

```{r}
f <- y ~ x + z
class(f)
```

***

We make use of formulae and create tables of variables in our data using `xtabs()` and `prop.table()`.  

```{r}
xtabs(~ MI, fhs)              # Table of MI in FHS
prop.table(xtabs(~ MI, fhs))  # Proportion table of MI in FHS
xtabs(~ MI + SEX, fhs)        # Table of MI by SEX
xtabs(~ MI, fhs[fhs$AGE>50, ])# Table of MI in individuals over 50
```

***

#### Question 4:

* Make a table of current smoking status
* Make a proportion table of BP medication
* Make a table showing the number of smokers for each education level

***

## Part 5: Data Manipulation

As mentioned above, `dplyr` is a `tidyverse` package that is frequently used for data summary and transformation. `dplyr` code is often more intuitive to read and use than base R packages for data manipulation.

This package contains a number of functions, which we will introduce one by one and then combine.

***

The `select()` function allows you to subset specific columns out of a dataset, similar to subsetting introduced above.

```{r}
fhsBP <- select(fhs, SYSBP, DIABP, BPMEDS)
head(fhsBP)
```

You can also perform negative indexing, using the `-` operator.

```{r}
fhsCOV <- select(fhs, -MI)
head(fhsCOV)
```

You can select a range of columns using the `:` operator, or use the `contains()` function to find all columns containing a specific word or combination of letters.

```{r}
fhsBP <- select(fhs, contains("BP"))
head(fhsBP)
```

This can come in very useful when subsetting data frames. Other useful functions include `starts_with()` and `ends_with()`, for column name prefixes and suffixes respectively.

***

In a similar manner to subsetting columns, `filter()` can be used to filter observations or rows.

```{r}
fhsBMI40 <- filter(fhs, BMI >= 40)
head(fhsBMI40)
```

Here, we can quickly see the individuals who are morbidly obese in our data set. A `,` can be used as a logical AND between filters. Perhaps we are interested in girls who are current smokers.

```{r}
fhsSmokeF <- filter(fhs, SEX == 'Female', CURSMOKE == 'Yes')
head(fhsSmokeF)
```

***

The pipe operator `%>%` is commonly used by `dplyr` and pipes output from one function to another. Instead of nesting functions, which can be difficult to read at a glance, `dplyr` instead pipes them.

Here, we pipe our data frame to the `filter()` function, and then show the result using `head`:

```{r}
fhs %>%
  filter(CURSMOKE == 'Yes', BMI < 20) %>%
  head
```

***

To re-order rows by a particular columns values, you can use the `arrange()` function. Perhaps you want to have a look at the youngest individuals in your data frame.

```{r}
fhs %>%
  arrange(AGE) %>%
  head
```

You can look at the oldest observations by using the `desc()` function inside `arrange()`.

```{r}
fhs %>%
  arrange(desc(AGE)) %>%
  head
```

***

Sometimes, you would like to create new columns as a function of the existing ones. In this instance, `mutate()` comes in handy.

To create a column for pulse pressure, we use the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

```{r}
fhs %>%
  mutate(PP = SYSBP - DIABP) %>%
  select(PP, SYSBP, DIABP) %>%
  arrange(desc(PP)) %>%
  head
```


Combining `mutate()` with `ifelse()` can help create helpful binary variables. 

The syntax of the `ifelse()` statement is `ifelse` (`condition`, `value if TRUE`, `value if FALSE`). So, below we create a new variable `HYPO` that takes the value `1` if `GLUCOSE` is 70 or less, and `0` otherwise.

If you want to use multiple conditions within `ifelse()`, you can use the `&` and `|` operators.

```{r}
fhs %>%
  filter(DIABETES == 'Yes') %>%
  mutate(HYPO = ifelse(GLUCOSE <= 70,1,0)) %>%
  select(DIABETES, GLUCOSE, HYPO) %>%
  head
```

Hopefully, you can start to see how using `dplyr` can help you get to know your data.

***

As well as manipulating data, you may also want to `summarise()` it. This can make exploring the distribution of variables very intuitive.

```{r}
fhs %>%
  summarise(TC_AVG = mean(TOTCHOL),
            TC_MIN = min(TOTCHOL),
            TC_MAX = max(TOTCHOL),
            TOTAL_N = n())
```

Multiple summary statistics are available, including `sd()`, `median()`, and `sum()`.

It can be really useful to combine functions with `group_by()`, which splits the data frame, performs the function, and then  combines the output. Here, we show the above output grouped by eduction level.

```{r}
fhs %>%
  group_by(EDUC) %>%
    summarise(TC_AVG = mean(TOTCHOL),
            TC_MIN = min(TOTCHOL),
            TC_MAX = max(TOTCHOL),
            TOTAL_N = n())
```

***

#### Question 5:

* What is the sex and smoking status of the youngest diabetic?
* What is the average systolic blood pressure of smokers who currently take blood pressure medication? 
* For diabetics who experienced MI, what is their mean age, BMI, and glucose level?
* How many obese smokers are in each education category? Do you notice a trend?
* Now look at the total number of people in each education category alongside the percentage who are obese smokers. Is there a trend now?

***

## See you tomorrow!

Hopefully, this introduction to the basics of R was informative and helpful. Tomorrow, we will start by diving into data visualisation and performing some statistical tests.
